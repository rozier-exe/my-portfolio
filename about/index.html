                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I'm a young french digital artist, trying to create peaceful and mesmerizing visuals. I started my art journey in the end of 2023 after discovering TouchDesigner and BenHeim's work. I could not take off my eyes from one of his masterpiece "Sunset Dreams".</p>
                <p>But everything has an end so a video too. So I decided to create my own visuals that I can watch anytime and anywhere ... And here I am.</p>
                <p>Now you know a little bit more about me, even if it's not so much.</p>
